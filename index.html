								<h1>Field Study:Bowne Park</h1>
								<p>Bowne park is located in Flushing, Queens. It contains 11.79 acres, and was once the site of State Senator and New York City Mayor Walter Bowne’s summer residence. Mayor Bowne was a descendant of John Bowne, one of the earliest immigrants to Flushing, and the Bowne family owned large portions of land in this area of Queens.</p>
								<p>Overall, Bowne park serves the community in many ways. While there are different physical structures like the pond, playground, and bocce and basketball courts that were built with specific purposes in mind, the open areas within the park also serve the different and changing needs of the community. Moreover, the park’s placement encourages frequent use and allows for different needs to be met.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Pond</h2>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Boat.jpg" 	alt="" /></span>

								<p>This picture shows the Bowne park pond, which was recently reconstructed in February 2023. There are benches surrounding the pond, and many people are sitting or walking around it on the weekends, when the park is especially busy. There are families with children that want to see the ducks near the pond, as well as older individuals that will sit together on the benches and talk to each other. During the reconstruction, much of this area was closed and its importance to the park as a whole was demonstrated. Some of the benches were blocked off, and those that were accessible had a poor view of the pond. Thus, there were less people walking and sitting, disrupting the level of activity normally seen.</p>
								<p>The shape and placement of the pond are features that encourage high use. It is near one of the park’s main entrances, and because it’s circular one could walk around it in a loop and end up back at the same entrance. This makes it easier for the elderly to enjoy the view without having to walk an excessive amount. Additionally, many of the locations with benches have two or more next to each other, as is seen in the photograph. This highlights that the designers expected this to be a popular area because they wanted to accommodate the higher traffic that it sees. Therefore, families can sit together and enjoy the view, and there is enough room for parents and grandparents as well. Groups of friends can also sit together.</p>

								<p>Another activity unique to the area is seen in the second photograph. Some residents gather together in the morning on weekends to use their remote controlled boats. This is not a wide spread hobby, but emphasizes the park’s ability to connect residents over shared interests. While this most likely wasn’t the designer’s intended use for the pond, the park is a public space and its character is created by those using it. Overall, it can be argued that the pond is the most popular area in Bowne park; a wide range of people enjoy it and it also brings the community together.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Bocce Courts</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic2.jpg.crdownload" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Bocce.jpg" 	alt="" /></span>

								<p>These are pictures of the Bocce courts that are on the opposite side of the park. This area is an example of a design with a clear purpose. Bocce was developed in Italy and is played around western, southern, and southeastern Europe, as well as in areas with Italian immigrant populations. Thus, the two Bocce courts in Bowne park are meant to serve the Italian population in the area, many of whom came to the United States in the later half of the twentieth century. Many first-generation Italian immigrants have now reached the age of retirement, and this area provides them with a space to gather together in the nice weather. This concrete section also has benches so that residents can sit and talk to each other when they’re not playing. The Bocce courts remain popular, and there are certain groups that frequent the area and have formed organized leagues with their own equipment. Tables set up for chess and checkers are also seen in the photograph. These tables are close enough to the courts to be used by those that are playing Bocce, but anyone else that wants to use them can do so without interfering with the courts. This area is easily accessible, and is separate from popular family areas such as the playground and pond. This ensures that the older demographic the area is meant to serve can walk along the paved path to this concrete area without having to worry about slippery or uneven patches of grass. They also don’t have to avoid children that are running around or playing, which could increase the chance of falling.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Playground</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic3.jpg.crdownload" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bball.jpg" 	alt="" /></span>

								<p>These two pictures display the playground and basketball courts, which are next to each other. The playground is obviously meant for families with elementary school children, and it is most popular on the weekends and in the early afternoons during the week after school. The playground includes two swingsets, sprinklers that are used during the summer, and a play area with slides and other features. This area is on the opposite side of the park compared to the pond, and has its own entrance from the street, which it borders. As was previously mentioned, this makes it easy to access and prevents any disruptions to other areas of the park. There are also benches within the playground where parents can sit and store items such as backpacks or strollers while also being able to remain close to their children.</p> 
	
								<p>The basketball court is used by older children, from about middle to high school, as well as adults. The court has an entrance from the playground for older children that may be interested in both areas, as well as an entrance from the street since the court is on the corner of the block. One issue with this area is that there is only one full basketball court. While different groups can use each half individually, during busier hours on the weekend there will often be a few people sharing the half-court as well. If a group was able to start playing a game, then others would have to wait, or perhaps the group could play a half-court game. However, because this is the main park for the general area it would be beneficial to add one more court. When there are many people that have to share a small space like this, it can be easy for one uncooperative person or group to make things difficult for everyone else by refusing to accommodate others.

								<p>These pictures highlight the placement of Bowne park within the community. Is it in a residential neighborhood and is surrounded by homes on all four sides. Thus, it is mostly used by residents in the immediate area. Another aspect of the park not yet described is the walking path around the park’s perimeter. While this is the sidewalk and doesn’t enter the park, most people in the area have cars, meaning there isn’t much foot traffic from those that are traveling from work, school, or to the grocery store. Thus, the perimeter of the park is mostly used by those who are walking or running and want to have the longer, uninterrupted paths. There are a good mix of people that use the sidewalk. Most are alone and are looking for a good area to exercise, however there are also pairs that may be walking and speaking to each other. There also isn’t a particular age range, although most that are running tend to be younger. The perimeter of the park also has benches facing the street for those that need to take a break. Since Bowne park isn’t too large, those that are using the sidewalk can also enjoy the park’s views even if they don’t directly enter it. Thus, the longer paths surrounding the park offer an opportunity for those that want to focus on exercising and allows them to avoid having to dodge the larger number of people that are often in the park.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Open Space</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Dancing.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Space.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>These pictures show the many open areas in the park and the different uses that residents have for them. While people may be playing fetch with their dogs and children may be running around, these areas have been used in other ways as well. For example, in the mornings on the weekend there are groups of asian women that perform well-choreographed dances to specific songs. This specific picture was from Mother’s day last year. Another use of this space is Tai Chi practiced by older populations of asian men and women. While the designers of the park most likely purposefully included these open areas, they couldn’t have predicted every use they would have. However, by incorporating such areas, the park is able to serve the diverse communities of the neighborhood. This also demonstrates the importance of the open space the park provides since most people either don’t have any yard where they live, or perhaps they have just enough for a small garden or to sit. Therefore, while the playground, Bocce courts, and pond are physical structures within the park with specific purposes, open areas add to Bowne park’s ability to adapt and provide the community with the area that can be used in different ways.</p>
